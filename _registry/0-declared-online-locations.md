# Registry


The registry contains a list of Declared Online Locations, which can be websites and webpages. 
These are online locations that have repeatedly carried three or more different online falsehoods which are the subject of active Directions issued by POFMA Office under Ministerial instruction within a period of 6 months, prior to the Declaration.
The public should exercise caution and do additional fact-checking, if accessing such online locations for information.
