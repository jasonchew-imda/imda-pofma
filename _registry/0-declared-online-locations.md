# Registry


The registry contains a list of Declared Online Locations, which can be websites and webpages. 
These are online locations that have carried three or more different online falsehoods which are the subject of active Directions issued within a period of 6 months, prior to the Declaration. 
The public should exercise caution and do additional fact-checking, if accessing these online locations for information. 

**There are currently no declared online locations.**
