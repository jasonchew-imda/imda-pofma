# Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act

POFMA targets falsehoods. It does not cover opinion, criticism, satire or parody. People can, and should, continue to express opinions and criticisms for healthy public debate.

A direction can only be issued if: 
There is a false statement of fact communicated in Singapore.
A Minister is of the view that it is in the public interest to issue the direction.
