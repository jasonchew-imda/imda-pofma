# Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA)

POFMA's primary tools to counter online falsehoods are the correction directions - these directions do not require the online falsehood to be removed. In more serious cases, a stop communication or disabling direction may be used. 

These directions can only be issued if: 
- A false statement of fact has been or is being communicated in Singapore through the Internet; and
- It is in the public interest to issue the direction.
