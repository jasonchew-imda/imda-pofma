The POFMA Office, situated within the Infocomm Media Development Authority, is responsible for the administration of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). 

This is part of the wider Whole-of-Government effort to combat the proliferation of fake news and misleading the public through deliberate online falsehoods to destabilise society. Together with public education efforts (e.g. A Better Internet campaign) to generate greater awareness of online safety measures, the POFMA Office focuses on falsehoods that are intentional and harmful to society.
