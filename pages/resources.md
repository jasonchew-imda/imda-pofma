Today, many people and groups produce online falsehoods to mislead others. These online falsehoods can affect lives and harm society.
Legislation is necessary, but not sufficient. Informed and alert Singaporeans remain the first line of defence against online falsehoods.
This is why the Government has been conducting public education: 
- National Library Board’s S.U.R.E programme provides tips on recognising fake news
- Government fact-checking website Factually provides accurate information on government policies and related issues
- Media Literacy Council’s News and Media Literacy Toolkit [for fact-checking] 
- CSA’s GoSafeOnline
