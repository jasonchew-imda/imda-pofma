# POFMA and Codes of Practice 
Details of the POFMA can be found here <insert link to AGC>.
In discharging its regulatory responsibility, the POFMA Office has developed codes of practice to ensure that intermediaries have adequate systems and processes in place to mitigate the risk of abuse of their platforms by malicious actors, and enhance the integrity of information online.

# Directions Under POFMA 
POFMA targets falsehoods. It does not cover opinion, criticism, satire or parody. People can, and should, continue to express opinions and criticisms for healthy public debate.
A direction can only be issued if: 
There is a false statement of fact.
It is in the public interest to issue the direction.
**Correction Directions will be used in most situations.** With the facts provided along with the falsehoods, people can discern for themselves.
