# Declared Online Locations 
The Registry contains a list of the Universal Resource Locators (URL), i.e. websites, that have been the subject of the POFMA Office’s issuance of Directions, at least 3 times within a period of 6 months. For example, a listed website would have spread 3 different falsehoods that were each subject to a Direction before it is a Declared Online Location. 

Due to their repeated carrying of online falsehoods which prejudices society, these website URLs are listed in the POFMA Office’s Registry as Declared Online Locations so that the public and digital advertising [intermediaries/ platforms ] would be made aware of their status . 

The public ought to exercise caution and do additional fact-checking, if accessing such declared websites for information.
